# Rücklab research group

Welcome to the Github page for Christian Rück's research group at Karolinska Institutet. The purpose is mainly internal collaboration on projects, but feel free to browse our public repositories while you are here!

You may also want to visit our [website](https://rucklab.com/) where we post updates related to our research.

Are you a member of the research group and want access to private repositories? Reach out to one of the members to receive an invite.
